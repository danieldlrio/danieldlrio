### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Daniel Del Rio and I'm an Electrical Engineering Master's student at CSULA.

#### Coding/Programming is a lot of fun to me so I try to take up as many courses on the topic as I can. My favorite language to use at the moment is C. Its tedious to some but I think that's why I enjoy it. When I'm not working on anything programming related, I'll probably be playing games.
